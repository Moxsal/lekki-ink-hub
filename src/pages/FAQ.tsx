    {
      question: "How much does a tattoo cost?",
      answer: "Tattoo pricing varies based on size, complexity, placement, and time required. We provide custom quotes after consultation. Small tattoos start from ‚Ç¶25,000, while larger pieces are priced based on hourly rates. We offer free consultations to discuss your design and provide accurate pricing."
    },
    {
      question: "Does getting a tattoo hurt?",
      answer: "Pain levels vary depending on placement, your pain tolerance, and tattoo size. Areas with more fat and muscle (like arms and thighs) tend to be less painful than bony areas (ribs, ankles). Most clients describe it as manageable discomfort. We use techniques to minimize pain and can take breaks as needed."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a tattoo take to heal?",
      answer: "Initial healing takes 2-3 weeks, while complete healing takes 3-6 months. During the first week, your tattoo will peel and scab. Following proper aftercare instructions is crucial for optimal healing and color retention. We provide detailed aftercare guidance and are available for questions."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do before my tattoo appointment?",
      answer: "Get a good night's sleep and eat a substantial meal before your appointment. Avoid alcohol for 24 hours prior. Wear comfortable clothing that provides easy access to the tattoo area. Bring a valid ID and any reference images. Stay hydrated and avoid blood-thinning medications unless prescribed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I bring my own design?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We encourage clients to bring reference images, ideas, or existing designs. Our artists can work with your design or modify it to better suit tattoo application and your body's contours. We also create completely custom designs based on your ideas and preferences."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you require a deposit?",
      answer: "Yes, we require a ‚Ç¶10,000 deposit to secure your appointment for custom work. This deposit goes toward your final tattoo cost. Deposits are non-refundable but can be transferred to a new appointment with 48-hour notice. Walk-in simple tattoos may not require deposits."
    },
    {
      question: "What aftercare products do you recommend?",
      answer: "We recommend gentle, fragrance-free moisturizers and antibacterial soap. Specific product recommendations include Cetaphil moisturizer and Dove sensitive soap. Avoid petroleum-based products initially. We provide an aftercare kit with your tattoo and detailed instructions for optimal healing."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you cover up or fix old tattoos?",
      answer: "Yes, we specialize in cover-ups and tattoo corrections. The possibilities depend on the size, color, and age of your existing tattoo. Darker tattoos may require lightening sessions first. We offer free consultations to assess your tattoo and discuss cover-up options and expected results."
    },
    {
      question: "What are your hygiene and safety standards?",
      answer: "We exceed industry safety standards with hospital-grade sterilization, single-use needles and equipment, and regular health department inspections. All surfaces are sanitized between clients, and we follow strict protocols for equipment handling. Our artists are bloodborne pathogen certified."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer piercing services?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer professional piercing services for ears, nose, and other body areas. We use sterile, single-use needles and high-quality jewelry. All piercings include aftercare instructions and follow-up support. Piercing prices start from ‚Ç¶8,000 depending on placement and jewelry choice."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get a tattoo if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?",
      answer: "We recommend waiting until after pregnancy and breastfeeding for safety reasons. While there's no proven risk, it's better to be cautious. The healing process may also be affected by hormonal changes. We're happy to do consultations and design work in preparation for when you're ready."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't like my tattoo design?",
      answer: "We work closely with you during the design process to ensure you love your tattoo before we start. We offer unlimited revisions during the consultation phase. Once we begin tattooing, changes become limited, so we ensure you're 100% satisfied with the design first."
